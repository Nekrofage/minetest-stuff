Just how I Installed Minetest, raspberryjammod and then edublocks on the PixelOS RaspberryPI desktop for PC

There was a far bit of trial and error so some of these steps can no doubt be improved, anyway here goes.

Download OS iso and write to usb stick.
Boot old laptop and select boot from usb.
Run with persistence.
Once the desktop boots ->add new software
  search for Minetest and select all of the items
  then add the socket library for lua
  add new software
  search for lua-sock and then select lua-socket-3.0~........

Next we need the raspberryjammod by arpruss for minetest
You can get here https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod-minetest

make a folder for minetest in your home ie
/home/pi/.minetest/mods
Download the zip and extract so that you end up with
/home/pi/.minetest/mods/raspberryjammod

Start Minetest and create a new world
Give it a name, mapgen v6 and select minetest rather than Minimal test
In the single player tab select your world and then configure
Make sure you enable raspberryjammod

Start the game
if you want to write some python or run a preexisting script open a terminal and go to
/home/pi/.minetest/mods/raspberryjammod/mcpipy
then from the command line
python yourscript.py
if all went well you should see some blocks being placed in minetest

So this should now run the same scripts that you could run on Minecraft-pi

Next I tried to get @edu_blocks working, this was a little bit tricky but I guess it was because I had no real 
clue what was going on ;)

I went to https://github.com/allaboutcode/edublocks
and ran the curl command which seemed to do a fair bit but I noticed that arm processor was referenced. It was no surprise
that I got an error when I tried to run edu_blocks
I went to /opt/edublocks/server in the terminal and ran ./start.sh so I could see what the issue was
The error told me that I could not execute the binary file format for the node program. I guessed that this was because I was 
on x86 rather than the arm processor in the pi.

So I tried
sudo apt-get install nodejs
I removed the node program at /opt/edublocks/bin/node
set up a symlink
ln -d /usr/bin/nodejs /opt/edublocks/bin/node
I got a different error which was because the system version of node was too old so I followed the instructions here
running all the instructions as sudo
https://gist.github.com/opi/1dce5be10717183ccc03
after that running 
node -v
indicated that the version was ok
I ran edublocks from the desktop and while it appeared to launch the server on port 8081 the program closed after a few minutes.
I went to /opt/edublocks/server in the terminal and ran ./start.sh again and the server worked.
Next open a browser and go to 127.0.0.1:8081
Success!
Edublocks loaded
so I put together a small minecraft script and got a cant find mcpi error
edublocks puts its python program in /home/pi/.edublocks so as a quick work around I copied the mcpi folder from 
/home/pi/.minetest/mods/raspberryjammod/mcpipy/mcpi and dumped the contents into ~/.edublocks

When I selected run I got a different error but when I looked at the code it seemed fine. I exported the code to ~./edublocks
and ran from the terminal.
The code ran and the blocks were placed in minetest.
After some digging it appeared to be a conflict in python versions. System python is 2.7 but edublocks was running python3.
In the terminal I changed to ~/.edublocks and ran the following
2to3 -w .
this made some changes to the code to make it python3 compatible
Back to edublocks ->Run ->Blocks placed in Minetest. Yay!

So a botched together solution of guesses and hacks but thats part of the fun :)

I am sure that people who know about these things can vastly improve on the above.

Best of Luck
