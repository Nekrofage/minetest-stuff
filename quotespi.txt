The computer 
programmer 
is a creator 
of universes 
for which she 
alone is 
responsible. 
Universes of 
virtually 
unlimited 
complexity 
can be
created in 
the form 
of computer 
programs.
Joseph Weizenbaum

good only 
because they 
fear 
punishment,
and hope 
for reward,
then we 
are a sorry 
lot indeed.

without 
character 
is a 
dangerous 
thing.

On two 
occasions 
I have been
asked by 
members 
of Parliament!,
'Pray, Mr. 
Babbage, if 
you put 
into the machine
wrong figures,
will the right 
answers come 
out'  
I am not able 
rightly to 
apprehend the 
kind of 
confusion 
of ideas that 
could provoke 
such a 
question.
Charles Babbage
Though a program 
be but three 
lines 
long, someday 
it will have 
to be 
maintained.

hurt others.

steep,
but you only 
have to 
climb it once.

associate;
else they 
will fall 
one by one,
an unpitied 
sacrifice 
in a 
contemptible 
struggle.
- Edmund Burke
Plan to throw 
one away.  
You will anyway.

conquer the
world.
